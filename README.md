## Workflow & Commands

**git status:**  
A way to check up on the status of your work.  
(use often as it can tell you if you added or committed your work along with some helpful hints.)

**git add:**  
Adds your edits to the staging area.  
(think of bringing people in the frame for a picture)

**git commit:**  
Commits whats on the staging area. _Sorta like finalizing it_  
(think of taking a picture of the people you had just added into frame)


The `-m ""` after `git commit` is for you to write a little note for yourself _and others_ on what you have done in that commit. It is best to keep it sort and make sure that you do not use past tense such as "changed" in your notes.


**git push:**  
Pushes your commits to your remote repository
